# PROJECT PROPOSAL 
## INTRODUCTION
This is a project to explore the different elements which impact
diurnal, noctornal, or cathemeral status. If predictive elements are
found, these elements will be applied to fossil primates.

## SOURCE OF DATA
The source of this data was procured from numerous published academic articles. I gathered 
different datasets from the supplemental data files of journal files from interest. 

## ANALYSIS 
The multiple sources of data were each imported into R as separate data frames. The data was evaluated and cleaned. This cleaning included removing irrelevant columns, changing the type of data when appropriate, creating new columns and renaming columns to a consistent pattern.
